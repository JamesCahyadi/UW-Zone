# UW-Zone

A website to read reviews about programs at University of Waterloo. This website aims to help solve the problem of high school students confused about which programs to apply to. These high school students will be able to search for reviews and be informed about various programs.

I encourage any Waterloo students or alumni to leave a review about their program on my website for all to see!
